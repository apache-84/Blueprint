# Team Contract

## Team Name: Apache-84   

**Date: January 14, 2025**

## Goals

As a group we share a desire to learn new technical skills while finding a balance between challenge and scope. We share a common goal to stay on track and succeed with as little miscalculations as possible.

Some of our individual goals are:

- Tread into uncomfortable territory and learn new technical skills.
- To have an end product that feels complete.
- Submit high quality work is completed well ahead of time.

## Expectations

- Complete tasks on time and maintain productivity. Ideally have each team member’s portion shared with the team at least 2 days before the due date (communicate otherwise).
- Each team member is present for each class session and if something were to pop up unexpectedly, we communicate this to other team members. The entire group attending each class will allow us to learn from one another and collaborate more effectively.
- Communicate with the team if experiencing difficulties with finishing tasks.
- Tell the team ahead of time if we are going to be absent for any lectures or labs.
- Do our work in the shared Google Docs so the team can track the progress.
- We have assigned team members' secondary roles to align with what technologies they wanted to learn. It is their responsibility to check in with the 'expert' of that area to help learn those skills and to produce quality work.
- Respect each other as people, if a teammate is facing a challenge, the team should address that challenge and support that teammate until they have overcome it.

## Rules of Conduct

- Timeline due dates must be met 24hrs in advance. If something cannot be met in time, communicate with the team.
- If it’s not yours, don’t put it in an LLM.
- Be there for group work and if you are unable to do your part of the deliverable, or have been stuck on a specific part for a few days, ask for help. 
- Balance work to be as fair as possible, if time is a problem to complete tasks alert your fellow teammates.
- Don’t rob others of learning opportunities (For example: by doing so much work that others don’t get a chance to).
- If you have an issue or concern with something happening in the group that is causing stress or conflict between team members, communicate that problem to the entire group instead of staying silent.

## Consequences for Violating Rules

- If it comes to the point of the group feeling that someone needs to be given consequences for their lack of involvement in the project, a team meeting will take place at the next class, in which we will try to come to a solution that works for everyone.
  - If there is no class within the next 2 days, the team will have to discuss this over Discord (in chat or voice call).
- Repeated reluctance to communicate would lead to a group discussion on a potential solution to the matter. If both parties cannot come to an agreement on a solution then the professor will be informed. 
- If a group member is being harassed, the teacher will be immediately alerted, no chances. 
- If workload is being unfairly distributed, the issue will first be discussed as a team, then we will find a solution that is agreed upon by all members. 
  - If there is no compromise, and members must complete a significantly greater portion of work than others, we will raise this issue with the professor to help fix the imbalance.

We the undersigned agree to this contract:
