# Interview Notes

This document contains the interview scripts, and the answers for each interview (not word for word, but summarized). 

Note: We separated our faculty and student questions into two separate scripts, rather than labelling each question with the user type it was intended for.

## Faculty Interview Script
Hello, my name is {NAME}, and I will be your interviewer today. Thank you for putting some time aside to do a requirements gathering interview for our system, Blueprint.VIU.CS. We really appreciate this as we know this time of the semester is busy for many. 

The goal of this interview is to ask a few questions to get a bigger picture of the faculty’s perspective of course reviews and feedback. Having faculty want to use our system is integral for our system to work, so we want to make sure that we are offering as much as we can to make this system useful for faculty in order to incentivize use for it when it is finished.

As you are the interviewee, it is our priority to keep your information protected so you may feel free to express your true opinions without concern of public perception. We will follow these steps to ensure privacy:
1. Interviewee names and contact information will be removed from the official interview notes document, as it will be put on our gitlab repository.
2. Any interviewee specific data will be kept in a secure document in a Google Drive that is only accessible to team members and shall not be shared to or viewed by anyone else.
3. We will assign you a unique interviewee ID and a user type (in this case, faculty) to keep the interview data and for reference in our documentation.

Q: How many hours per week do you think students should spend outside of class to succeed in your courses?

Q: What issues do you experience when receiving feedback from your taught courses? What improvements to this feedback would be beneficial?

Q: Have you received feedback from past students about the difficulty or workload of certain courses or terms? If so, have any adjustments been made based on that feedback?

Q: What specific skills or knowledge do you assume students already have when they start this course? How do you accommodate those who may not have that background?

Q: How do you determine if a course is too difficult or too easy for students?

Q: If you were to see us use this review system, do you think VIU could benefit from it? Would you use it?

Q: If students leave reviews, what context do you think should be considered?

Do you have any questions about our system that you were not able to ask earlier? Any additional comments or concerns?

Once again, thank you for your time, it is much appreciated. We hope that we can meet with you in the future regarding this project!

## Appendix: Faculty Interview Feb 6, 2025 (ID: 1)

Hello, our names are Christoper and Casey, and we will be your interviewers today. Thank you for putting some time aside to do a requirements gathering interview for our system, Blueprint.VIU.CS. We really appreciate this as we know this time of the semester is busy for many.

3. We will assign you a unique interviewee ID and a user type (in this case, faculty) to keep the interview data and for reference in our documentation.

Q: How many hours per week do you think students should spend outside of class to succeed in your courses?
A: The number of hours spent outside of class should match the number of hours spent in class.

Q: What issues do you experience when receiving feedback from your taught courses? What improvements to this feedback would be beneficial?
A: I typically receive feedback directly from students in one-on-one sessions. However, I would like to know who is providing the feedback so I can better understand their context and situation.

Q: Have you received feedback from past students about the difficulty or workload of certain courses or terms? If so, have any adjustments been made based on that feedback?
A: Yes, I have made adjustments based on student feedback. For example, I’ve modified my delivery by slowing down and focusing more on challenging topics for students. I also review exam and test results to identify areas where additional instruction is needed.

Q: What specific skills or knowledge do you assume students already have when they start this course? How do you accommodate those who may not have that background?
A: I base my expectations on the prerequisite structure. While there are no official accommodations for students who struggle with prerequisite knowledge, I offer extra help when needed.

Q: How do you determine if a course is too difficult or too easy for students?
A: Computer science courses are well established, and professors understand what needs to be covered. I rely on assignment feedback and encourage students to ask questions. Course difficulty is also assessed based on expected learning outcomes, faculty experience, and keeping up with current technology.

Q: If you were to see us use this review system, do you think VIU could benefit from it? Would you use it?
A: Absolutely. It could serve as a valuable communication tool between faculty and students. For example, platforms like Discord are too social, whereas something more formal would be beneficial. However, anonymity is a key consideration.

Q: If students leave reviews, what context do you think should be considered?
A: It’s important to understand whether students providing reviews are actually attending the course, performing well, or facing outside challenges. There needs to be a way to justify the validity of their reviews.

Do you have any questions about our system that you were not able to ask earlier? Any additional comments or concerns?
A: N/A

Q: How do you decide which courses to take each semester? What factors influence your decision the most?
A: I go off the list of classes I need to graduate and take everything I can.

Q: How do you determine if a course will be manageable for you? Have you ever misjudged a course’s difficulty? What happened?
A: Yes I took a 485 course and it was just linear algebra in python and I dropped it two weeks in. Most courses aren’t that bad. Humayun's course usually takes 10+ hours a week though.

Q: What would motivate you to leave a course review? What makes a review helpful for you?
A: At this point I only leave a review when I really hated a professor's course. Reviews aren’t helpful at VIU because you have to take the course with that professor to graduate. You can’t do anything with the information

Q: Have you had experiences where your semester’s course load was too heavy? What could have helped you avoid this?
A: A trust fund would make things easier. I have to work so I can only dedicate so many hours to school. If I wasn’t poor I could manage 6 classes.

Do you have any questions about our system that you were not able to ask earlier? Any additional comments or concerns?
A: N/A

## Appendix: Faculty Interview Feb 12, 2025 (ID: 3)

Hello, my name is Luka, and I will be your interviewer today. Thank you for putting some time aside to do a requirements gathering interview for our system, Blueprint.VIU.CS. We really appreciate this as we know this time of the semester is busy for many. 

The goal of this interview is to ask a few questions to get a bigger picture of the faculty’s perspective of course reviews and feedback. Having faculty want to use our system is integral for our system to work, so we want to make sure that we are offering as much as we can to make this system useful for faculty in order to incentivize use for it when it is finished.

1. Interviewee names and contact information will be removed from the official interview notes document, as it will be put on our gitlab repository.
2. Any interviewee specific data will be kept in a secure document in a Google Drive that is only accessible to team members and shall not be shared to or viewed by anyone else.
3. We will assign you a unique interviewee ID and a user type (in this case, faculty) to keep the interview data and for reference in our documentation.

Q: How many hours per week do you think students should spend outside of class to succeed in your courses?

A: I expect 8 hours per week (class and out of class) for a 3 credit course, and 10 hours per week for a 4 credit course. So outside of class and labs, a 3 credit course would be 4 hrs per week, a 4 credit course would be 5 hours per week.

I view being successful in my courses as understanding every concept and being able to apply what is (or has been) taught to other things (future assignments, other courses, etc.) Generally if you’re in the B range or above and strong conceptually, you’re succeeding in my course.

Q: What issues do you experience when receiving feedback from your taught courses? What improvements to this feedback would be beneficial?

A: Often students don’t want to give feedback in the middle of the semester because they feel like the professor will hold that against them and mark them lower. I think an anonymous mechanism would help greatly in making students feel comfortable sharing feedback. 

VIU’s current system for feedback is highly optional, so there is trouble incentivizing people to write a review unless they had a polarizing experience (really bad or really good).

For what would be beneficial, identifying which aspect of the course was the most difficult/heavy workload would help (was studying for exams, doing assignments, or following lectures the hardest?). Additionally, the nature of what was challenging is important, some tasks are challenging not because of the mental difficulty but more so the amount of time it requires, causing you to fall behind or not complete assignments.

Q: Have you received feedback from past students about the difficulty or workload of certain courses or terms? If so, have any adjustments been made based on that feedback?

A: Yes I have received more feedback on certain courses (for example: CSCI 265 documentation). Yes, I’ve made changes based on that feedback. Right now, I’m planning on revamping the 265 project model to follow a hybrid ‘scrum-waterfall’ model.

Also, sometimes I’ve taught the same course content with different groups of people, such as CSCI 159 which has computer science students and CSCI 160 which has engineering students, which has generated different feedback in the past. 

Q: What specific skills or knowledge do you assume students already have when they start this course? How do you accommodate those who may not have that background?

A: I assume students have had no background experience in first year. After that,
any core concepts in prereq courses I assume they’ve got a firm grasp of. If students don’t have that understanding or haven’t fulfilled certain prereqs, I point them to resources to learn those concepts.

Q: How do you determine if a course is too difficult or too easy for students?
A: Often it is from listening to students’ reactions and how they are doing in the course (like overhearing them chat with their group, or how they react to me saying x and y). Overall, trying to be approachable enough so students feel ok with communicating these struggles with me is one of the main things I focus on.

Q: If you were to see us use this review system, do you think VIU could benefit from it? Would you use it?
A: I would love to see something like that. If students feel safe giving feedback, that would be great, however, try to encourage a lot of people to give feedback, maybe by having some sort of reward to incentivize them, as this system wouldn’t be useful without a large set of data, especially from those who didn’t have an extreme experience in a course.

Q: If students leave reviews, what context do you think should be considered?
A: I personally wouldn’t want it tied to grades, and I don’t know what other context I’d want, other than for students to provide their own context they’re coming from in their review.

Do you have any questions about our system that you were not able to ask earlier? Any additional comments or concerns?

A: I think that instructors/faculty would benefit from being able to communicate back to students in some form. Whether it is over proposed changes or justifying why something is the way it is so that students understand. A two-way communication system would be better than having one group tell the other what to do constantly.

Once again, thank you for your time, it is much appreciated. We hope that we can meet with you in the future regarding this project!


## Appendix: Student Interview Feb 12, 2025 (ID: 4)

Hello, my name is Casey, and I will be your interviewer today. Thank you for putting some time aside to do a requirements gathering interview for our system, Blueprint.VIU.CS. We really appreciate this as we know this time of the semester is busy for many. 

The goal of this interview is to ask a few questions to get a bigger picture of the students’ perspective of course reviews and feedback. Having students want to use our system and leave course reviews is integral for our system to work, so we want to make sure that we are offering as much as we can to make this system useful for students in order to incentivize use for it when it is finished.

3. We will assign you a unique interviewee ID and a user type (in this case, student) to keep the interview data and for reference in our documentation.

Q: How do you decide which courses to take each semester? What factors influence your decision the most?
A: Well I look at the courses I'm required to take, and I look at those first, if not I look and I can’t take those I try to take other comp sci courses. If I can’t take those I try to look for something else interesting.

Q: How do you determine if a course will be manageable for you? Have you ever misjudged a course’s difficulty? What happened?
A: There were two instances where I felt as if I misjudged a course's difficulty, the first one being data structures and algorithms, and the second being calculus 2. For DSA, I had taken a DSA course before, and it was a lot less rigorous, so I had a lot less expectations about the workload. The VIU courses were a lot more difficult than my last time. For Calc 2 I thought it would be hard, but it turned out to be really freaking hard, because I suck at math. 

Q: What would motivate you to leave a course review? What makes a review helpful for you?
A: I would leave a review of the course upon completion, if it were available to me in all circumstances. 

Q: Have you had experiences where your semester’s course load was too heavy? What could have helped you avoid this?
A: No, I am very good at judging workload and I always lean on the side of caution. I always know what I can manage. The only time I felt really stretched for time was when I was working alongside school, where I had to make sacrifices to one side rather than the other. 


Do you have any questions about our system that you were not able to ask earlier? Any additional comments or concerns?

A: Two factors that influence me taking a course would be who is teaching it, and what courses are available in the coming semester or not. Knowing ahead of time lets me understand what I need to take now or later. 

Once again, thank you for your time, it is much appreciated. We hope that we can meet with you in the future regarding this project!
