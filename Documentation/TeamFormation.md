## Team Name

**Apache-84**
 
## Document Overview

The purpose of this document is to assign team members roles for development going further into the project. It will also give contact information including name and email, as well as plans for how communication will be done during the project’s development cycle. This will feature a Synchronous communication method and an Asynchronous communication channel. This document will also lay out how task tracking will function using github’s Kanban board to allocate tasks during the development cycle. Finally, our team will give a preliminary proposal of the project which will highlight improvement or support user’s well-being through VIU.Then be followed up with food for thought on analysis, design, and deployment of the information system we will make, with its intended purpose of supporting VIU members within the community.

## Task Tracking

For our project we will use gitlabs integrated Issue board system. We decided to use documentation, modeling, addressing past feedback, development, and testing, to be our labels on our issue boards. We set this up so that way we can monitor the cycle of the project. As well as raise potential concerns and issues during development. We will be using the task tracker to illustrate steps for each assignment.  

## Preliminary Proposal

We decided the main purpose of our project will be to improve or support user’s well-being through VIU. 

We intend this project to have a great impact on the students who attend VIU and give awareness to some of the difficulties of the road map of going through the Computer Science Major which is offered. We intend for this project to help lead students down a suitable path for themselves which will benefit their journey.

Our initial plan is that we will be constructing a project which will take data from VIU CS students and organize said data to represent different attributes in a database. This includes data such as difficulties of classes, times spent per course, and more. 

The main users of our system will be VIU CS students who want to have an efficient graduation path and minimize the chance of failing classes due to a high semester workload. 

Another group who could benefit from the system are the VIU CS teachers and faculty. The system will allow them to see which semesters have a much higher workload than others in order to alter the program to be more balanced across all semesters.

To highlight features we wish to have for our initial release, we are looking to have these core features implemented by the end of A6:

**Core Features:** 
* Flashcards containing course data, which includes: 
	* A tag of what year the course is recommended to be taken (1-4), and whether it is offered in the fall, spring, or both.
* Course difficulty (0-5 rating)
* Time recommended per week to spend on the course
* Importance (low, medium, or high -> based on how many courses this course is a prerequisite for, and if it is a graduation requirement)
* The main topics/description of the course.
* All current sections and their times (for the next year)
* Search feature which allows you to look up courses by:
	* Course code (e.g. CSCI 260)
	* Year (1-4)
	* Terms offered (fall, spring, summer, both)
	* More search options would be a stretch goal.
* Semester average difficulty rating (based on courses selected)
* Review system or system for collecting data
	* Allow students to submit difficulty rating and time recommended for a course
